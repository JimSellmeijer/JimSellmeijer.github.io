In 2016, I graduated *magna cum laude* with a doctorate degree in Neuroscience. During my studies, I enjoyed the creative process of writing analysis software and machine learning algorithms to facilitate my research, and in doing so realized my passion for data science and software development.
 
In the four years that followed, I worked as a Software Developer, building and implementing software solutions for companies like Haufe, PDV and one of the leading business networks in Germany. Filling a gap within the company, I became a certified SCRUM master within the Agile framework and successfully managed the development team at Searchtalent GmbH. 

As a Software Developer and Data Scientist, I develop powerful applications and restful APIs, scrape the web, train predictive algorithms such as neural net classifiers and regressors, work on frontends and analyze many sets of data.
