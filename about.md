In 2016, I graduated magna cum laude with a doctorate degree in Neuroscience. During my studies, I enjoyed the creative process of writing analysis software and machine learning algorithms to facilitate my research, and in doing so realized my passion for data science and software development.

In the four years that followed, I transferred to HR tech as a Software Developer and Data Scientist, building and implementing software solutions as well as Data Science projects. Filling a gap within the company, I became a certified Scrum master within the Agile framework and became technical lead for the development team at Searchtalent GmbH.

In September 2020, I took on the role of CTO as a co-founder of Workbee. Workbee is a digital job and career platform catering to professionals and assistants in the nursing, medical, and social work fields. Our primary focus is to optimize the recruitment process, making it both efficient and precise.
At Workbee, we have developed a cutting-edge recommender system called the "Passt-Genau-Filter." This innovative tool enables us to match the desires and skills of our candidates with the specific requirements of our clients' job opportunities. As a result, we assist candidates in discovering job positions that represent a significant improvement over their current employment situation.
Our platform offers a user-friendly experience, providing highly personalized job selections tailored to each individual. By utilizing the "Passt-Genau-Filter," we strive to empower candidates in finding their ideal job and career path in the nursing, medical, or social work fields.

As the CTO, I am responsible for shaping the technical landscape and turning our ideas into reality. I am the lead in crafting the entire technical architecture and overseeing the development of our app. Drawing upon my experience in data science, I leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to improve our product and to foster data-driven decision making. Furthermore, I am the  go-to person for all matters relating to security and privacy. 

Being responsible for the product development, I chart the strategic direction of our product. This involves making critical decisions about where our product should be heading in the coming years. I relish the challenge of blending technical acumen with an understanding of market demands, customer needs, and industry trends to create a compelling product roadmap.
At Workbee, I wear multiple hats as a leading manager. My leadership extends to guiding and nurturing a talented team of software developers and UX researchers.
