I"{<p>In 2016, I was awarded my PhD in Neuroscience with <em>magna cum laude</em>. During my studies, I enjoyed the creative process of writing analysis software and machine learning algorithms to facilitate my research, and in doing so realized my passion for data science and software development.</p>

<p>In the four years that followed, I became a certified Scrum master and successfully managed the development team at Searchtalent GmbH within the agile framework. Moreover, as a Software Developer, I have built and implemented software solutions for scientific publications and for companies like Haufe, PDV and one of the leading business networks in Germany.</p>

<p>As a Software Developer and Data Scientist, I develop powerful applications and restful APIs, scrape the web, train predictive algorithms such as neural net classifiers and regressors, work on frontends and analyze many sets of data.</p>
