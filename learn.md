Have you always wanted to learn how to program but don't know where to start? Or perhaps you are stuck on a project and need some help. In any case, I am there for you. No matter your level, I can help you get familiar with many concepts of programming, data science and statistics.

With low supply and high demand, software development has quickly risen to become one of the best sectors to work in. Learning how to program may seem daunting, and following courses online requires a lot of self-discipline and perseverance. Having a teacher who helps you get past the early hurdles of programming will keep you motivated and moving forward.
