Are you looking for a python developer to strengthen your team? Or perhaps, you already have a team but have trouble managing it. In either case, you have come to the right address. 

With over 4 years of experience in Python programming, machine learning, statistics and Scrum (agile) software development I have built and implemented many software solutions that are currently in use by companies like Haufe, XING and PDV or have led to scientific publications. 

In addition to working as a python developer and data scientist, I became a certified Scrum master and have successfully managed the development team at Searchtalent GmbH within the agile framework.

I have developed many powerful applications and restful APIs, scraped the web, trained predictive algorithms (such as neural net classifiers and regressors), worked on frontends and analyzed many sets of data. 
So if you're looking for a motivated self-starting individual that brings software solutions to your challenges, be sure to read through my [CV](curriculum_vitae.html) and get in touch with me through the contact channels listed below.
