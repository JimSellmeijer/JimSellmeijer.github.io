subtitle: Software development, Data science and Scrum consulting
description: Are you looking for a Software Developer or Sata Scientist to strengthen your team? Or perhaps, you already have a team but have trouble managing Agile software development. In either case, you have come to the right address. With over 4 years of experience in Python programming, machine learning, statistics and Scrum (Agile) software development, I have built and implemented software solutions for scientific publications and for companies like Haufe, PDV and a well-known German professional network site. In addition to working as a Software Developer and Data Scientist, I became a certified Scrum Master and have successfully managed the development team at Searchtalent GmbH within the Agile framework.
