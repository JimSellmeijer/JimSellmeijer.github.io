Are you looking for a software developer or data scientist to strengthen your team? Or perhaps, you already have a team but have trouble managing agile software development. In either case, you have come to the right address. 

With over 4 years of experience in Python programming, machine learning, statistics and Scrum (agile) software development, I have built and implemented software solutions for scientific publications and for companies like Haufe, PDV and a well-known German professional network site. 

In addition to working as a python developer and data scientist, I became a certified Scrum master and have successfully managed the development team at Searchtalent GmbH within the agile framework.

I have developed many powerful applications and restful APIs, scraped the web, trained predictive algorithms (such as neural net classifiers and regressors), worked on frontends and analyzed many sets of data. 
So if you're looking for a motivated self-starting individual that brings software solutions to your challenges, be sure to read through my [CV](curriculum_vitae.html) and get in touch with me through the contact channels listed below.
