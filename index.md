landing-title: 'Hi, my name is Jim'
description: Are you looking for a freelance Software Developer or Data Scientist to strengthen your team? Or perhaps, you already have a team but have trouble managing Agile software development. With over 4 years of experience in Python programming, machine learning, statistics and Scrum (Agile) software development I have built and implemented many software solutions that are currently in use by companies like Haufe, XING and PDV or have led to scientific publications. In addition to working as a Software Developer and Data Scientist, I became a certified SCRUM Master and have successfully managed the development team at Searchtalent GmbH within the Agile framework.
