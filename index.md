landing-title: 'Hi, my name is Jim'
description: Are you looking for a freelance software developer or data scientist to strengthen your team? Or perhaps, you already have a team but have trouble managing agile software development. With over 4 years of experience in Python programming, machine learning, statistics and Scrum (agile) software development I have built and implemented many software solutions that are currently in use by companies like Haufe, XING and PDV or have led to scientific publications. In addition to working as a python developer and data scientist, I became a certified Scrum master and have successfully managed the development team at Searchtalent GmbH within the agile framework.
